                                                For German players only- On 01.07.2012, the German authorities
                                                introduced a taxation of betting stakes for sports bets. In
                                                accordance
                                                with § 17 of the racing bets and lotteries act, taxation of
                                                betting stakes will be set at 5% of the stake. In the case of
                                                won bets,
                                                the customer will pay a fee towards the taxation amount which
                                                will be deducted from their winnings. The fee will be 5% of
                                                gross winnings
                                                (stake multiplied by the odds). Once the taxation fee has been
                                                deducted from the gross winnings, the net winnings will be
                                                transferred to the customer’s account.
                                                This amount will be charged to users whose permanent place of
                                                residence is in Germany and who are in Germany at the time of
                                                placing a bet. This does not apply when users
                                                place bets from outside the Federal Republic of Germany. For
                                                taxation purposes, the company is therefore permitted to use
                                                geolocation technology to determine the actual location of
                                                the user at the time of placing a bet and to save this
                                                information for use in taxation calculation and auditing by the
                                                financial authorities. Furthermore, the company is also required
